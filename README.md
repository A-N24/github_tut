## Branching

Branching is a way to work on different version of a repository at one time. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.

When you create a branch off the `main` branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of `main` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `main` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

### 1. Create Branch

To create a new branch, click on the `Current Branch` button on the top left of the screen and click on `New Branch`.

![picture14](resources/image_2023-07-28_08-47-02.png)

Give the branch a name and click `Create Branch` button.

![picture15](resources/image_2023-07-28_08-48-14.png)

Any change you made on the new branch will not affect the `main` branch.

### 2. Merge Branch

To merge the branch to `main` branch, click on the `Current Branch` button on the top left of the screen and click on `main` branch.

![PICTURE16](resources/image_2023-07-28_08-54-17.png)

Click on `Choose a branch to merge into main` button.
